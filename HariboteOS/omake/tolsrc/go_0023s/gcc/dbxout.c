/* Output dbx-format symbol table data.
   This consists of many symbol table entries, each of them
   a .stabs assembler pseudo-op with four operands:
   a "name" which is really a description of one symbol and its type,
   a "code", which is a symbol defined in stab.h whose name starts with N_,
   an unused operand always 0,
   and a "value" which is an address or an offset.
   The name is enclosed in doublequote characters.

   Each function, variable, typedef, and structure tag
   has a symbol table entry to define it.
   The beginning and end of each level of name scoping within
   a function are also marked by special symbol table entries.

   The "name" consists of the symbol name, a colon, a kind-of-symbol letter,
   and a data type number.  The data type number may be followed by
   "=" and a type definition; normally this will happen the first time
   the type number is mentioned.  The type definition may refer to
   other types by number, and those type numbers may be followed
   by "=" and nested definitions.

   This can make the "name" quite long.
   When a name is more than 80 characters, we split the .stabs pseudo-op
   into two .stabs pseudo-ops, both sharing the same "code" and "value".
   The first one is marked as continued with a double-backslash at the
   end of its "name".

   The kind-of-symbol letter distinguished function names from global
   variables from file-scope variables from parameters from auto
   variables in memory from typedef names from register variables.
   See `dbxout_symbol'.

   The "code" is mostly redundant with the kind-of-symbol letter
   that goes in the "name", but not entirely: for symbols located
   in static storage, the "code" says which segment the address is in,
   which controls how it is relocated.

   The "value" for a symbol in static storage
   is the core address of the symbol (actually, the assembler
   label for the symbol).  For a symbol located in a stack slot
   it is the stack offset; for one in a register, the register number.
   For a typedef symbol, it is zero.

   If DEBUG_SYMS_TEXT is defined, all debugging symbols must be
   output while in the text section.

   For more on data type definitions, see `dbxout_type'.  */
