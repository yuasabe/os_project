/* This pass converts stack-like registers from the "flat register
   file" model that gcc uses, to a stack convention that the 387 uses.

   * The form of the input:

   On input, the function consists of insn that have had their
   registers fully allocated to a set of "virtual" registers.  Note that
   the word "virtual" is used differently here than elsewhere in gcc: for
   each virtual stack reg, there is a hard reg, but the mapping between
   them is not known until this pass is run.  On output, hard register
   numbers have been substituted, and various pop and exchange insns have
   been emitted.  The hard register numbers and the virtual register
   numbers completely overlap - before this pass, all stack register
   numbers are virtual, and afterward they are all hard.

   The virtual registers can be manipulated normally by gcc, and their
   semantics are the same as for normal registers.  After the hard
   register numbers are substituted, the semantics of an insn containing
   stack-like regs are not the same as for an insn with normal regs: for
   instance, it is not safe to delete an insn that appears to be a no-op
   move.  In general, no insn containing hard regs should be changed
   after this pass is done.

   * The form of the output:

   After this pass, hard register numbers represent the distance from
   the current top of stack to the desired register.  A reference to
   FIRST_STACK_REG references the top of stack, FIRST_STACK_REG + 1,
   represents the register just below that, and so forth.  Also, REG_DEAD
   notes indicate whether or not a stack register should be popped.

   A "swap" insn looks like a parallel of two patterns, where each
   pattern is a SET: one sets A to B, the other B to A.

   A "push" or "load" insn is a SET whose SET_DEST is FIRST_STACK_REG
   and whose SET_DEST is REG or MEM.  Any other SET_DEST, such as PLUS,
   will replace the existing stack top, not push a new value.

   A store insn is a SET whose SET_DEST is FIRST_STACK_REG, and whose
   SET_SRC is REG or MEM.

   The case where the SET_SRC and SET_DEST are both FIRST_STACK_REG
   appears ambiguous.  As a special case, the presence of a REG_DEAD note
   for FIRST_STACK_REG differentiates between a load insn and a pop.

   If a REG_DEAD is present, the insn represents a "pop" that discards
   the top of the register stack.  If there is no REG_DEAD note, then the
   insn represents a "dup" or a push of the current top of stack onto the
   stack.

   * Methodology:

   Existing REG_DEAD and REG_UNUSED notes for stack registers are
   deleted and recreated from scratch.  REG_DEAD is never created for a
   SET_DEST, only REG_UNUSED.

   * asm_operands:

   There are several rules on the usage of stack-like regs in
   asm_operands insns.  These rules apply only to the operands that are
   stack-like regs:

   1. Given a set of input regs that die in an asm_operands, it is
      necessary to know which are implicitly popped by the asm, and
      which must be explicitly popped by gcc.

	An input reg that is implicitly popped by the asm must be
	explicitly clobbered, unless it is constrained to match an
	output operand.

   2. For any input reg that is implicitly popped by an asm, it is
      necessary to know how to adjust the stack to compensate for the pop.
      If any non-popped input is closer to the top of the reg-stack than
      the implicitly popped reg, it would not be possible to know what the
      stack looked like - it's not clear how the rest of the stack "slides
      up".

	All implicitly popped input regs must be closer to the top of
	the reg-stack than any input that is not implicitly popped.

   3. It is possible that if an input dies in an insn, reload might
      use the input reg for an output reload.  Consider this example:

		asm ("foo" : "=t" (a) : "f" (b));

      This asm says that input B is not popped by the asm, and that
      the asm pushes a result onto the reg-stack, ie, the stack is one
      deeper after the asm than it was before.  But, it is possible that
      reload will think that it can use the same reg for both the input and
      the output, if input B dies in this insn.

	If any input operand uses the "f" constraint, all output reg
	constraints must use the "&" earlyclobber.

      The asm above would be written as

		asm ("foo" : "=&t" (a) : "f" (b));

   4. Some operands need to be in particular places on the stack.  All
      output operands fall in this category - there is no other way to
      know which regs the outputs appear in unless the user indicates
      this in the constraints.

	Output operands must specifically indicate which reg an output
	appears in after an asm.  "=f" is not allowed: the operand
	constraints must select a class with a single reg.

   5. Output operands may not be "inserted" between existing stack regs.
      Since no 387 opcode uses a read/write operand, all output operands
      are dead before the asm_operands, and are pushed by the asm_operands.
      It makes no sense to push anywhere but the top of the reg-stack.

	Output operands must start at the top of the reg-stack: output
	operands may not "skip" a reg.

   6. Some asm statements may need extra stack space for internal
      calculations.  This can be guaranteed by clobbering stack registers
      unrelated to the inputs and outputs.

   Here are a couple of reasonable asms to want to write.  This asm
   takes one input, which is internally popped, and produces two outputs.

	asm ("fsincos" : "=t" (cos), "=u" (sin) : "0" (inp));

   This asm takes two inputs, which are popped by the fyl2xp1 opcode,
   and replaces them with one output.  The user must code the "st(1)"
   clobber for reg-stack.c to know that fyl2xp1 pops both inputs.

	asm ("fyl2xp1" : "=t" (result) : "0" (x), "u" (y) : "st(1)");
