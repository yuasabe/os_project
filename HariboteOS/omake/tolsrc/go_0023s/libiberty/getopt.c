/* This version of `getopt' appears to the caller like standard Unix `getopt'
   but it behaves differently for the user, since it allows the user
   to intersperse the options with the other arguments.

   As `getopt' works, it permutes the elements of ARGV so that,
   when it is done, all the options precede everything else.  Thus
   all application programs are extended to handle flexible argument order.

   Setting the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT disables permutation.
   Then the behavior is completely standard.

   GNU application programs can use a third alternative mode in which
   they can distinguish the relative order of options and other arguments.  */
